Create a new repo with your GitHub 
Pull that repo to your computer, open it with PyCharm
Create structure of your PyCharm project: 
Add features package 
add steps package into features
add tests package into features
add environment.py file into features (Make sure this file is inside features package, not inside steps or tests)
Add pages package
Add base page into the page object into pages package
Add app package
Add application.py into the app package
Start building test cases
Take a Jira ticket
Move it from “To Do” to “In Progress” 
When the test case is complete, push it to GitHub
In Jira, add a comment to the ticket and put a link to your commit in that comment
Then move the ticket to “Code Review”
Your work on the ticket in complete for now, move on to another Jira ticket
Your commits will be reviewed by our QA Automation Engineer, if everything is ok, they’ll move your tickets from “Code Review” to “Done”, otherwise, they’ll leave a comment and move the tickets back to “To Do” 
If your ticket is back in “to do” state, just fix the issues mentioned by our Automation Engineer in another commit, attach a new commit link to the ticket and move the ticket to “Code Review” again
